# Machine-Learning-Project-2
The goal is to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data. Also known as "Adult" dataset.  
The problem was taken from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/census+income.  
The code is provided by a .R file, the data is attached as a .csv file and there is an hebrew report (PDF).
